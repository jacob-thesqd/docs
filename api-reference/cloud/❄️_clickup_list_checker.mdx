## Workflow Details

- **Workflow ID**: `T0VzydHfUqWnds7O`
- **Status**: Active
- **Created**: June 19, 2025
- **Last Updated**: July 2, 2025

## Webhook Endpoint

```
POST https://churchmediasquad.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/clickup-list-checker
```

## Workflow Process

### 1. Webhook
- **Purpose**: This is the trigger node for the workflow. It listens for incoming HTTP POST requests on the `/clickup-list-checker` path.
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Response Mode**: Responds via a specific node (`Respond to Webhook`).
- **Sticky Note**: There's a critical sticky note associated with this webhook: "### DO NOT TOUCH! **Changing the webhook will change it in A LOT of workflows.**" This emphasizes the importance of not altering this webhook's configuration.

### 2. prf_ministry_dept
- **Type**: PostgreSQL Node
- **Operation**: Select
- **Purpose**: This node queries the `prf_general_submissions` table in the PostgreSQL database to retrieve the `raw_data` column. It filters the records based on the `submission_id` received from the webhook's JSON body (`{{ $json.body.giid }}`).

### 3. ClickUp List
- **Type**: PostgreSQL Node
- **Operation**: Select
- **Purpose**: This node queries the `clickup_lists` table in the PostgreSQL database. It searches for an active list (`active` column set to `true`) that matches the `memberid` (`account` column) and `list_type` (`list_type` column) provided in the webhook's JSON body. It also sorts by name in descending order and limits the result to 1.

### 4. If
- **Type**: If Node
- **Purpose**: This node checks if a `list_id` was found in the preceding `ClickUp List` node. It specifically checks if the `id` field from the output of the `ClickUp List` node exists.

### 5. Respond to Webhook
- **Type**: Respond to Webhook Node
- **Purpose**: If the `If` node determines that a `list_id` was found (meaning a matching ClickUp list exists), this node is executed. It responds to the webhook with a JSON object containing the `spaceid`, `folderid`, and `listid`. The `listid` is either taken from an override in the `raw_data` of the `prf_general_submissions` table or from the `id` of the `ClickUp List` node's output.

### 6. Error
- **Type**: Respond to Webhook Node
- **Purpose**: If the `If` node determines that no matching ClickUp list was found (the `id` field from the `ClickUp List` node does not exist), this node is executed. It responds to the webhook with a 400 Bad Request status code and no data, indicating an error.

## Data Flow

```
Webhook -> prf_ministry_dept -> ClickUp List -> If -> (Respond to Webhook OR Error)
```

## Authentication

### PostgreSQL
- **Credential ID**: `ckrZxGCgviCXh9wc`
- **Name**: `Squad Data`

## Error Handling

- **Error Workflow**: `6hQvch97iNP5ny1i`
- **Execution Order**: `v1`
- **Continue on Error**: Not explicitly configured for specific nodes, but the workflow structure handles the "not found" case via the `If` node.
