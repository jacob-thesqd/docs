title: "mySquad Chrome Ext (Webhook3 - PATCH)"
description: "This workflow listens for incoming webhook triggers with a PATCH request to add tasks to the queue. It then processes task details, updates statuses, removes/adds tags in ClickUp, and updates related PostgreSQL entries accordingly, ensuring task progression and queuing logic are handled efficiently."
api: "PATCH /add-to-queue"

## Trigger: Webhook (Webhook3)
- Listens on the path "add-to-queue" for PATCH requests.
- Response mode: "lastNode" to relay the final output downstream.
- Incoming payload: `{"id":"02f90c6f-09fb-4617-b2f5-401d0d094767","name":"Webhook3","type":"n8n-nodes-base.webhook"}` at position `[20,920]`.

## Nodes Overview
- The workflow primarily starts with the Webhook trigger, then branches into data processing, database updates, and tag management in ClickUp, followed by responses to the original webhook.

---

## Webhook (Webhook3)
- **Purpose:** Receives PATCH requests containing the task ID to add to the queue.
- **Parameters:** Path set to `"add-to-queue"`.
- **Response Mode:** "lastNode" ensures the response is sent after all processing.

---

## Webhook (Webhook)
- **Purpose:** Listens for incoming task-specific webhooks, particularly for further task status or tag updates.
- **Important:** Internal API call tied to the initial webhook trigger; positioned at `[160,2700]`.

---

## PostgreSQL Nodes
### Postgres
- **Purpose:** Retrieves detailed task info including current status, tags, assignees, time estimates, created date, etc.
- **Query:** Complex SQL query aggregating multiple subqueries to get the latest task status, tags, time spent, assignee histories, and other metadata based on the incoming `taskId`.
- **Position:** `[900,2940]`.

### Postgres8
- **Purpose:** Retrieves list details, such as list name and associated account info.
- **Query:** Determines list and folder names for the given task's list ID and folder.
- **Position:** `[900,2680]`.

### Postgres1
- **Purpose:** Fetches latest status, due date, time estimates, project folder info, department, and created date for the task.
- **Query:** Uses distinct on queries to get latest entries per task.
- **Position:** `[-300,600]`.

### Postgres2
- **Purpose:** Retrieves employee details (name, department, email, clickup_id) for each assignee.
- **Query:** Selects employee info based on assignee IDs.
- **Position:** `[900,1800]`.

### Postgres4
- **Purpose:** Fetches existing statuses from a `clickup_statuses` table for tag/color management.
- **Query:** Selects from `clickup_statuses` where color is not null.
- **Position:** `[900,3180]`.

### Postgres5
- **Purpose:** Logs actions into `aa_log`, such as queuing actions.
- **Query:** Inserts or updates queue info.
- **Position:** `[640,840]`.

---

## Set Nodes (Edit Fields)
### Edit Fields / Edit Fields2 / Edit Fields3 / Edit Fields4 / Edit Fields5 / Edit Fields6 / Edit Fields7
- **Purpose:** Populate or update task data fields such as task ID, account, project info, status, time estimates, assignee info, and visual indicators.
- **Example:** Updating queue numbers, status, and timestamps, formatting date/time for display, and preparing data for database updates or UI refresh.

---

## ClickUp Actions
- **Update Task Status:** `ClickUp2` sets task status to "open" and removes assignees in the "design squad" or "video squad" from the task.
- **Remove/Remove Tag:** `ClickUp3` removes the "queued" tag from the task.
- **Add Tag:** `ClickUp5` adds the "queued" tag to the task.
- **Post Comment:** (Disabled/Example) posts comments or retrieves comments for context.
- **Update Tasks:** Functions update task fields like status, description, tags.
- **Purpose:** These nodes manage tags and status in ClickUp based on queue operations.

---

## Webhook for Processing
- **Webhook2 (Reviewed):** Listens on path `"reviewed"` with POST method.
- **Purpose:** Capture review submissions or status updates.

---

## Conditional Logic (Switch)
- **Purpose:** Routes processes based on whether change status, tags to add/remove, or leave comment are enabled.
- **Conditions:** Checks `preferences.changeStatus.enabled`, presence of tags to add/remove, and comment enable flag.

---

## Other Nodes
### Response Nodes
- Respond to original webhook with confirmation or status.
- **Nodes:** `Respond to Webhook1` at `[2800,2720]`.

### Merge and Split Nodes
- Used for combining data streams or splitting out tags for individual processing.
- **Nodes:** `Merge`, `Merge1`, `Merge2`, `Merge3`, `Split Out`, `Split Out1`, `Split Out2`.

---

## Data Handling & Logic
- **Queue Management:** Updates database tables (`aa_log`) with queued task info.
- **Status Updates:** Synchronizes task `status`, `tags`, `assignees`, and related metadata in PostgreSQL and ClickUp.
- **Tag Management:** Removes and adds tags based on preferences and task state.
- **Time & Date Formatting:** Adjusts timestamps to CST for consistent display.
- **Error Handling:** Continues on errors for some database nodes to ensure process flow.

---

## Summary
This workflow automates queuing and status management of tasks via a webhook trigger, with extensive data aggregation from PostgreSQL, task updates in ClickUp, and status/tag synchronization. It ensures tasks are correctly queued, tagged, and tracked in external systems, providing real-time updates and logging.
