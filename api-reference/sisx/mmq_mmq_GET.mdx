title: "MMQ (Webhook - GET)"
description: "This API setup documents a webhook trigger that listens for GET requests at /mmq, corresponding to incoming request data for processing and subsequent steps involving database and API interactions."
api: "GET /mmq"
---

## Workflow Overview

This workflow is initiated by an HTTP GET request to the `/mmq` endpoint. It serves as a trigger for further actions including querying a Postgres database, updating records, and responding accordingly. The workflow manages incoming request data, evaluates conditions, updates task statuses in third-party tools like ClickUp, and maintains synchronization with internal databases.

---

## Request Example

<RequestExample>

```bash Request
curl --request GET \
  --url https://sisx.thesqd.com/webhook/mmq
```

</RequestExample>

---

## Trigger: Webhook (`n8n-nodes-base.webhook`)

The workflow is triggered by a GET Webhook node listening at the path `mmq`. It responds with raw response mode, capturing incoming GET requests to initiate the process.

**Parameters:**
- Path: `mmq`
- Methods: `GET`, `PATCH`
- Response Mode: `responseNode`
- Multiple Methods: `true`

---

## Node: Sticky Note ("# Logo", `n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote`)

Provides a visual annotation labeled "# Logo" with dimensions 1000x320, likely used as a visual indicator or title note in the workflow diagram.

---

## Nodes: Postgres Queries and Data Operations

### Postgres2 (`n8n-nodes-base.postgres`)

Executes a `SELECT * FROM get_account_task_stats({{ $json.account }}) JOIN accounts a ON a.account = {{ $json.account }}` to retrieve current account task statistics.

**Parameters:**
- Query: Fetch account task stats for the given account ID from incoming data.
- Operation: `executeQuery`

### Postgres7 (`n8n-nodes-base.postgres`)

Drops and recreates materialized views to ensure data freshness:
- `mv_future_dates`
- `mv_latest_due_date`
- `mv_latest_assignee_status`
- `mv_latest_time_estimate`

Uses SQL commands to refresh these views, ensuring subsequent queries have up-to-date information.

### Postgres12 (`n8n-nodes-base.postgres`)

Loads tasks information filtered by account with several nested joins:
- Latest status changes
- Latest assignee data
- Due dates
- Time tracking
- Tags and department info
- Filtering out deleted or archived tasks, and specific tags (like 'creativediscovery' or 'artdirection').

**Operation:** `executeQuery`

**Parameters:**
Complex SQL query dynamically includes account value and filtering logic to retrieve current task statuses, assignments, tags, and other metadata.

---

## Node: Merge (`n8n-nodes-base.merge`)

Merges data from the previous steps into a unified dataset for further evaluation and processing. It uses `combine` mode with position matching, primarily based on `task_id`.

---

## Node: Condition Check (`n8n-nodes-base.if`)

Checks if `task_id` exists in the incoming data.

**Parameters:**
- Condition: `EXISTS` on `task_id` in the previous data.
- Response if false: No further action.

---

## Node: ClickUp Update (`n8n-nodes-base.clickUp`)

Updates task status back in ClickUp:
- Sets the task status to `"on hold"` based on `task_id`.

**Credentials:**
- ClickUp API with saved token.

---

## Nodes: Set Data (`n8n-nodes-base.set`)

### Edit Fields (`Edit Fields12` and `Edit Fields13`)

- Assigns `task_id`, `status`, `active`, and `due_date` fields from previous data, aligning task metadata for later processing and responses.

### Convert to File (`convertToFile`)

Converts the `base64` binary data into a file format, likely for attaching or exporting.

---

## Nodes: Webhook Responders

### Respond to Webhook (`respondToWebhook` for `play-pause`)

Returns a JSON response indicating the status of the requested operation.

---

## Node: Switch (`n8n-nodes-base.switch`)

Routes processing based on the `action` value (`pause` or `play`) received in message body, enabling different paths for handling task state changes.

---

## Nodes: Set Fields for Play/Pause (`Edit Fields9`)

Sets `task_id`, `status`, and `active` fields accordingly, preparing for updates on task status.

### Respond Webhook (`respondToWebhook`)

Sends back simple confirmation messages after processing actions.

---

## Additional Postgres Nodes

Various Postgres nodes (`Postgres13`, `Postgres14`, `Postgres17`, etc.) perform complex operations:
- Updating logs (`mmq_log`)
- Adjusting task statuses
- Fetching historical data (`status_history`, `due_date_history`)
- Managing Blackouts and scheduling constraints
- Reordering queues and updating task metadata

These nodes typically run on conditions or triggers within the workflow, sometimes disabled (`disabled:true`) for maintenance or future use.

---

## Final Operations: Completion & Data Synchronization

Multiple nodes coordinate to:
- Reorder queues
- Update task statuses (`clickUp`)
- Save logs
- Respond to external systems

Handling success states (`executionStatus":"success"`) complete the process cycle.

This SSH overview describes a highly dynamic, multi-node interaction system for managing tasks, scheduling, and communication across databases and third-party tools, with the webhook at `/mmq` acting as the primary trigger for the entire orchestration.
