## Trigger: Webhook Node "Webhook"
- Listens for POST requests at the path `availability-api`, with response mode set to respond through a response node.

## 1. Edit Fields: "Edit Fields1"
- Sets fields with raw JSON output `$json.body`, allowing access to incoming data for subsequent nodes.

## 2. Limit: "First 2 Days Out"
- Limits the input items to the first N designers with the earliest availability if multiple options are provided.
- `maxItems` is dynamically calculated based on the index of the designer out in more than 2 days: 
```plaintext
maxItems = {{$input.all().indexOf($input.all().find(i=>i.json.days_out > $input.all().find(i=>i.json.days_out >  $input.first().json.days_out).json.days_out))}}
```

## 3. Respond Nodes: "Previous", "Top", "Preference >= 2"
- These nodes immediately respond based on different conditions:
  - **Previous:** Responds if the previous desiger was a prior designer (`prev_des == 1`) and high_usage is false.
  - **Top:** Responds with the top result.
  - **Preference >= 2:** Responds if the designer preference score is >= 2 and high_usage is false.

## 4. Switch: "Switch"
- Routes the flow into different cases:
  - **prev:** If the previous designer was a prior designer and not high usage.
  - **preference:** If preference score >= 2 and not high usage.
  - **fallback ("extra"):** If none of the above conditions are met.

## 5. Execution Data: "Execution Data"
- Saves the `taskId` from the webhook body into execution data for later reference.

## 6. Merge Nodes: "Merge2", "Merge3"
- Merge multiple data streams for cohesive processing:
  - **Merge2:** Combines previous, preference, or top responses.
  - **Merge3:** Combines the data for further processing with the code node.

## 7. Set: "Edit Fields" (Post-processing)
- Sets detailed info for the assigned designer, including:
  - `task_id` from webhook.
  - `account` and `designer` details obtained from prior nodes.
  - All options (`all_choices`).
  - `designer_data` for context.
  - `explanation_pl` and `explanation_pl_md` containing formatted messages explaining the assignment, generated via JavaScript.

## 8. Code: "Code"
- Runs JavaScript to generate a detailed message explaining why the designer was selected, considering preference score, previous designer status, available minutes, and earliest availability.
- Returns `message` and `message_md`.

## 9. Final Merge: "Merge3"
- Combines the generated message with other data for logging.

## 10. Postgres: "Postgres1"
- Logs the decision into the `aa_decision_log` table.
- Columns include `task_id`, `designer`, `all_choices`, `assignee_id`, `designer_data`, `explanation_pl`, `explanation_pl_md`, `execution_id`, among others.
- Uses credentials with ID `E1ZzQqtaKFgPZ75x`.

---

## 11. Workflow Management Nodes
- **Check Estimate is Correct:** Executes sub-workflow to verify task estimate.
- **Blackouts:** Executes blackout period check for the designer.
- **Get Availabilities:** Retrieves designers' availability data based on the task requirements.

---

## Pin Data: "Webhook" Payload
- Contains the original incoming data, notably:
```json
{
  "taskId": "86dx2j86n",
  "resp_dept": "Design Squad",
  "high_usage": false,
  "accountLink": "2686",
  "projectName": "Rock N Ribs Invite Card",
  "project_type": "LayoutSM",
  "time_estimate": 30,
  "max_days_future": 15,
  "min_days_future": 3
}
```

This detailed structure shows the flow from receiving the webhook request, processing data, decision-making, and logging the outcome meticulously.
